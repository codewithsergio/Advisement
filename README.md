#Student Advisement Sign in Records Application

Developed an online sign in sheet for the CADV Advising department at my university so students didn't need to sign in with pen and paper, and can instead do it online through a QR code. It also includes a student records view so only admin gmail accounts can access it, through this view admins can view all student data submitted and can even delete all records. There is a feature that allows admins to export the records as a csv file to easily import it into an excel or google sheets file.

This is the student form view, where they can enter data such as their name and student id, and also a reason for advising. The application doesn't allow students to submit the form if the name is empty, if the student id isn't 9 digits long, and if there is no selected reason for the visit.

Due to student security and safety, I will not show the student records view, but it is essentially a tabular view of the information.
